# Planets
This is my portfolio.

## Setup
It supposes that you've already installed Node.js.

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Debug GUI
if you want to try debugging in GUI, add `/#debug` to the end of URL.
